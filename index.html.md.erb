This topic provides an overview of Tanzu Build Service (Beta).

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> To request early access to this Tanzu Build Service beta release, contact <a href="https://pivotal.io/contact">Pivotal</a>.</p>

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> This release of Tanzu Build Service is not intended for use in a production environment. Features are subject to change without notice in future releases.</p>


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

Tanzu Build Service uses the open-source [Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io) project to turn app source code into [container images](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/master/spec.md). Build Service executes reproducible builds that align with modern container standards, and additionally keep the images up-to date. It does so by leveraging kubernetes infrastructure with [kpack](https://github.com/pivotal/kpack), a Cloud Native Bulidpacks Platform, to orchestrate the image lifecycle.

You can use Build Service to develop and automate containerized software workflows securely and at scale.


## <a id='concepts'></a> Build Service Concepts

Build Service reduces operational overhead and improves security by automating the building of application images.
It relies on `images`, `builders`, `stacks` and `stores` to achieve these results. It additionally provides optional `projects` to simplify kubernetes multitenancy and manage access to the aforementioned resources.

### <a id='image'></a> Images

An `image` defines the source of the application, build time environment and registry destination. This source code could reside in git, a blobstore or as code on a workstation.

For more information about managing images in Build Service, see the [Manage Images](using.html#manage-images) section of the _Using Tanzu Build Service_ topic.

### <a id='builders'></a> Builders

A `builder` references the stack and buildpacks that are used in the process of building source code. They "provide" the buildpacks that run against the application and the OS images upon which the application is built and run.

For more information about creating and managing builders in Build Service, see the [Manage Builders](using.html#manage-builders) section of the _Using Tanzu Build Service_ topic.


### <a id='store'></a> Stores

A `store` serves as a repository for Cloud Native Buildpacks available for use in builders. One can populate a store with buildpacks they [create](https://buildpacks.io/docs/buildpack-author-guide/create-buildpack/) and [package](https://buildpacks.io/docs/buildpack-author-guide/package-a-buildpack).


### <a id='stacks'></a> Stacks

A `stack` defines a pair of build and run OS images. Critical security vulnerabilities are addressed by building apps on the most up-to date stack. The stacks used by Build Service to build applications are referenced in the builders.


### <a id='project'></a> Projects

A `project` is optional resource that helps simplify multi-tenancy on the build service kubernetes cluster. It allows creation of project specific `images`, `builders` and `secrets` while still allowing access to cluster wide resources. Project authentication is managed by the cluster's auth provider and authorization is handled by kubernetes RBAC.

For more information about creating and managing projects in Build Service, see the [Manage Projects](using.html#manage-projects) section of the _Using the Tanzu Build Service_ topic.
