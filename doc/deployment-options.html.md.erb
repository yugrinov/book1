title: "Choosing your Deployment Option"
---

There are two available options to deploy the Greenplum Database:

- [Option 1: Deploying Greenplum Using a Pre-built OVA](deploying-using-ova.html)
- [Option 2: Deploying Greenplum Using Your Own Template](deploying-byo-template.html)

With the first option you download a pre-configured Greenplum Database OVA, while the second option requires building your own template.
The following table highlights the differences between the two options:

| Option 1 | Option 2 |
| ------------- | -------- |
| Photon OS 3.0 | CentOS 7 |
| Automated process | Manual process |
| Deployment time around 30 minutes | Deployment time around 2 hours |
| Limited support for security & compliance customization | Fully customizable based on security & compliance requirements |
