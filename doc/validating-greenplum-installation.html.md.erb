title: "Validating the Greenplum Installation"
---

Run the commands below from the master node as `gpadmin` user in order to validate basic functionality of the Greenplum cluster.

1. Refresh the environment variables:

    ```
    $ source ~/.bashrc
    ```

1. Show the state of the Greenplum cluster:

    ```
    $ gpstate
    ```

1. Connect to the `postgres` database and check segment configuration information:

    ```
    $ psql postgres
    postgres=# SELECT * FROM gp_segment_configuration ORDER BY hostname;
    ```

1. Once connected to the `postgres` database, verify that you can create a table, insert data to it and read it:

    ```
    postgres=# CREATE TABLE t AS SELECT generate_series(1, 1000000);
    postgres=# SELECT MIN(cnt), MAX(cnt), COUNT(cnt) FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) cnt FROM t GROUP BY gp_segment_id) tt;
    postgres=# DROP TABLE t;
    ```
