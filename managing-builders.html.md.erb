A Custom Builder is a Tanzu Build Service resource used to manage [Cloud Native Buildpack builders](https://buildpacks.io/docs/concepts/components/builder/).

Custom Builders contain a set of buildpacks and a stack that will be used to create images.

There are two types of Custom Builders:

* Custom Cluster Builders: Cluster-scoped Builders
* Custom Builders: Namespace-scoped Builders

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Only Build Service Admins can manage Custom Cluster Builders.</p>

## <a id='create-builder'></a> Creating a Custom Builder

Use the `kp` cli to create a Custom Builder:

* Custom Cluster Builder:

	```
    kp custom-cluster-builder create <name> <tag> --order <order> --stack <stack> --store <store>
    ```

* Cluster Builder:

	```
    kp custom-builder create <name> <tag> --order <order> --stack <stack> --store <store> --namespace <namespace>
    ```

`kp ccb create` and `kp cb create` are respective aliases.

Where:

* `name`: The name of the builder.
* `tag`: The registry location where the builder will be created.
* `stack`: The name of the stack to be used by the builder.
* `store`: The name of the store containing the buildpacks that will be used by the builder.
* `namespace` The kubernetes namespace for the builder (for Custom Builders only)
* `order`: The local path to the buildpack order YAML that the builder will use.
  Sample order YAML files will be available on the [VMware Tanzu Build Service Dependencies](https://network.pivotal.io/products/tbs-dependencies) page on Tanzu Network.
  For more information about listing buildpacks in groups in the order YAML, see [builder.toml](https://buildpacks.io/docs/reference/builder-config/#order-_list-required_) in the Buildpacks.io documentation.

  Example order YAML file that would be used by a builder designed to build NodeJS and Java apps:

  ```
  ---
  - group:
	- id: paketo-buildpacks/bellsoft-liberica
	- id: paketo-buildpacks/gradle
  - group:
	- id: paketo-buildpacks/nodejs
  ```

## <a id='patch-builder'></a> Patching a Custom Builder

You can update a Custom Builder resource using the `kp` cli. To update a custom builder given a `name`, run:

* Custom Cluster Builder:

	```
    kp custom-cluster-builder patch <name> --order <order> --stack <stack> --store <store>
    ```

* Cluster Builder:

	```
    kp custom-builder patch <name> --order <order> --stack <stack> --store <store> --namespace <namespace>
    ```

`kp ccb patch` and `kp cb patch` are respective aliases.

Where:

* `name`: The name of the builder.
* `stack`: The name of the stack to be used by the builder.
* `store`: The name of the store containing the buildpacks that will be used by the builder.
* `namespace` The kubernetes namespace for the builder (for Custom Builders only)
* `order`: The local path to the buildpack order YAML that the builder will use.
  Sample order YAML files will be available on the [VMware Tanzu Build Service Dependencies](https://network.pivotal.io/products/tbs-dependencies) page on Tanzu Network.
  For more information about listing buildpacks in groups in the order YAML, see [builder.toml](https://buildpacks.io/docs/reference/builder-config/#order-_list-required_) in the Buildpacks.io documentation.

  Example order YAML file that would be used by a builder designed to build NodeJS and Java apps:

  ```
  ---
  - group:
	- id: paketo-buildpacks/bellsoft-liberica
	- id: paketo-buildpacks/gradle
  - group:
	- id: paketo-buildpacks/nodejs
  ```

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The `tag` (location in a registry) of a custom builder cannot be modified. To change this field, you must create a new custom builder.</p>

## <a id='delete-builder'></a> Deleting Builders

To delete a Custom Builder:

* Custom Cluster Builder:

    ```
    kp custom-cluster-builder delete <builder name>
    ```

* Custom Builder:

    ```
    kp custom-builder delete <builder name> --namespace <namespace>
    ```

<p class='note'><strong>Warning:</strong> Deleting a builder will prevent image configs that reference that builder from successfully building again.</p>

## <a id='get-builder-details'></a> Retrieving Builder Details

To get builder details:

* Custom Cluster Builder:

    ```
    kp custom-cluster-builder status <builder-name>
    ```

* Custom Builder:

    ```
    kp custom-builder status <builder-name> --namespace <namespace>
    ```

## <a id='list-builders'></a> Listing Builders

To list all builders available to the current user:

* Custom Cluster Builder:

	```
    kp custom-cluster-builder list
    ```

* Custom Builder:

	```
	kp custom-builder list --namespace <namespace>
	```

## <a id='kpack-builder-resources'></a> Corresponding kpack Resources

All Build Service Custom Builders are represented as kpack resources.
