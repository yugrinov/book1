After you configure and install Build Service, you can use the `kp` CLI to interact with your Build Service installation.

For more information, see [Installing Tanzu Build Service](installing.html).

The `kp` cli uses the local `KUBECONFIG` utilized by `kubectl`. All operations will be performed on the current context's namepace.

To use your Build Service installation, gain kubeconfig access to the Kubernetes Cluster that has the Build Service installed.

For example, if you are using PKS:

    pks login -a <PKS URL> -u <username> -p <password>

    pks get-credentials <cluster> -a <PKS URL> -u <username> -p <password>
