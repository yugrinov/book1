title: Updating Build Service Dependencies
owner: Build Service Team
---

Keeping applications up-to-date with the latest dependency patches is a core feature of Tanzu Build Service. Updates to dependencies will be propagated to application images. The resources that account for these patches are:

- **ClusterStacks** - Update a ClusterStack to patch operating system packages.
- **ClusterStores** - Update a ClusterStore to patch the Cloud Native Buildpacks used to build your applications.

You can use the `kp` CLI to update any resource.

## <a id='online-update'></a> Updating Dependencies

### <a id='online-bulk-update'></a> Bulk Update

This workflow can be used to update all dependencies (stacks and stores) in Tanzu Build Service with a single command. This can be used as a wholesale way to keep Tanzu Build Service up-to-date.

You can update all of the dependencies that are installed by default with Tanzu Build Service with the `kp import` command.

1. Download the Dependency Descriptor file (`descriptor-<version>.yaml`) from the latest release on the [Tanzu Build Service Dependencies](https://network.pivotal.io/products/tbs-dependencies/) page on Tanzu Network.

2. Use the `kp` CLI

```
kp import -f desciptor-<version>.yml
```

The following stacks will be updated with the latest Operating System patches:

```
base
default
full
tiny
```

The following store will be updated with the latest Cloud Native Buildpacks:

```
default
```

### <a id='online-stack-update'></a> Cluster Stacks Update

This section described how to update individual cluster stacks. This provides a more fine-grained way to patch operating system packages.

New stack versions will be provided on the [Tanzu Build Service Dependencies](https://network.pivotal.io/products/tbs-dependencies/) page on Tanzu Network.

To update specific cluster stacks with the `kp` CLI:

```
kp clusterstack update base --build-image registry.pivotal.io/tbs-dependencies/build-base --run-image registry.pivotal.io/tbs-dependencies/run-base
kp clusterstack update default --build-image registry.pivotal.io/tbs-dependencies/build-full --run-image registry.pivotal.io/tbs-dependencies/run-full
kp clusterstack update full --build-image registry.pivotal.io/tbs-dependencies/build-full --run-image registry.pivotal.io/tbs-dependencies/run-full
kp clusterstack update tiny --build-image registry.pivotal.io/tbs-dependencies/build-tiny --run-image registry.pivotal.io/tbs-dependencies/run-tiny
```

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Both build and run images need to be provided to update the stack.</p>

The updated stack can be viewed with the following command:

```
kp clusterstack status <stack-name>
```

### <a id='online-store-update'></a> Cluster Store Update

Cluster Stores contain all of the buildpackages (one or more packaged Cloud Native Buildpacks) to be used by Builders to build application images.

Patch Cloud Native Buildpacks in Tanzu Build Service by adding new buildpackage versions to the store.

To list the buildpackages available in a store:

```
kp clusterstore status <store-name>
```

To show a complete list of all buildpacks available in a store:

```
kp clusterstore status <store-name> --verbose
```

Update a store with one or more buildpackages with:

```
kp clusterstore add <store-name> -b <buildpackage-image1> -b <buildpackage-image2>
```

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Any number of buildpackages can be added to a store at a time with multiple `-b` flags.</p>

#### <a id='online-store-update-tanzu-net'></a> Updating Buildpacks From Tanzu Network

New Cloud Native Buildpacks (packaged as buildpackages) will be available on [Tanzu Network](https://network.pivotal.io)
and should be uploaded to a Tanzu Build Service to keep application images patched.

New versions of the Java, NodeJS, and Go buildpacks will be released on their respective Tanzu Network pages:

* [Java](https://network.pivotal.io/products/tanzu-java-buildpack)
* [NodeJS](https://network.pivotal.io/products/tanzu-nodejs-buildpack)
* [Go](https://network.pivotal.io/products/tanzu-go-buildpack)
* New versions of all other buildpacks will be released on the [Tanzu Build Service Dependencies](https://network.pivotal.io/products/tbs-dependencies) page.

Here is a list of how to update each buildpack that is included with Tanzu Build Service by default:

```
kp clusterstore add default registry.pivotal.io/tanzu-java-buildpack/java:<version>
kp clusterstore add default registry.pivotal.io/tanzu-nodejs-buildpack/nodejs:<version>
kp clusterstore add default registry.pivotal.io/tanzu-go-buildpack/go:<version>
kp clusterstore add default registry.pivotal.io/tbs-dependencies/paketo-buildpacks_dotnet-core:<version>
kp clusterstore add default registry.pivotal.io/tbs-dependencies/tanzu-buildpacks_php:<version>
kp clusterstore add default registry.pivotal.io/tbs-dependencies/tanzu-buildpacks_nginx:<version>
kp clusterstore add default registry.pivotal.io/tbs-dependencies/tanzu-buildpacks_httpd:<version>
kp clusterstore add default registry.pivotal.io/tbs-dependencies/paketo-buildpacks_procfile:<version>
```

Additionally, multiple buildpackages can be added to Build Service by passing multiple image references:

```
kp clusterstore add <store-name> registry.pivotal.io/buildpacakge-1 registry.pivotal.io/buildpackage-2 registry.pivotal.io/buildpackage-3
```

## <a id='online-update'></a> Offline Update of Dependencies

The stack images and buildpacks used by build service can be updated by first downloading those images and saving them as a .tar file. This file can be provided to the `kp` CLI to import to Tanzu Build Service.

1. Download the Dependency Descriptor file (`descriptor-<version>.yml`) from the latest release on the [Tanzu Build Service Dependencies](https://network.pivotal.io/products/tbs-dependencies/) page on Tanzu Network.

2. Download the `kp` CLI for your operating system from the latest release on the [Tanzu Build Service](https://network.pivotal.io/products/tbs-dependencies/build-service) page.

3. Download the `kbld` CLI for your operating system from the latest release on the [kbld](https://network.pivotal.io/products/kbld) page.

4. Download the dependency images for Tanzu Build Service to your local machine with `kbld`:

```
docker login registry.pivotal.io

kbld package -f descriptor-<version>.yml \
  --output /tmp/packaged-dependencies.tar
```

5. Move the output file `packaged-dependencies.tar` to a machine that has access to the "offline" environment

6. Upload the dependency images to the registry used to deploy Tanzu Build Service:

```
docker login <build-service-registry>

kbld unpackage -f descriptor-<version>.yml \
  --input /tmp/packaged-dependencies.tar \
  --repository <IMAGE-REPOSITORY> \
  --lock-output /tmp/dependencies-relocated.lock
```

Where `IMAGE-REPOSITORY` is the repository used to install Tanzu Build Service. This should be the same value as `IMAGE-REPOSITORY` used in the [Installation Steps](installing.html#other-install).

7. Now that dependencies are relocated to the internal registry, you can use the following command to update the necessary resources:

```
kbld -f descriptor-<version>.yml -f /tmp/dependencies-relocated.lock | kp import -f -
```
